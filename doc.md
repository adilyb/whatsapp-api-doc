## 2. API Authentication

You must authenticate each API request using an access token obtained from Facebook's Graph API.

### Steps:
1. Get an OAuth token:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     "https://graph.facebook.com/v10.0/oauth/access_token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&client_secret=YOUR_APP_SECRET"
   ```

2. Include this token in your API requests using the Authorization header:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

## 3. Sending Messages

{
   "to": "PHONE_NUMBER",
   "type": "text",
   "text": {
       "body": "Hello, this is a test message!"
   }
}
```

### Media Messages
You can send images, audio, or video by attaching media URLs.

**Example: Send an Image**
```bash
POST /v1/messages
{
   "to": "PHONE_NUMBER",
   "type": "image",
   "image": {
       "link": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
   }
}
```

### Interactive Messages
Interactive messages include buttons, lists, or replies.

**Example: Button Template**

   "interactive": {
       "type": "button",

       },
       "action": {

## 4. Message Templates

To send messages outside of the 24-hour customer service window, you must use pre-approved message templates.

### Create Message Template
1. Log in to Facebook Business Manager.
2. Go to **WhatsApp Manager** > **Message Templates** > **Create Template**.
3. Submit the template for approval.

**Example: Template Message**
```bash
POST /v1/messages
{
   "to": "PHONE_NUMBER",
   "type": "template",
   "template": {
       "namespace": "your_namespace",
       "name": "template_name",
       "language": {
           "code": "en_US"
       },
       "components": [
           {
               "type": "body",
               "parameters": [
                   {
                       "type": "text",
                       "text": "Hello!"
                   }
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
}
```

## 5. Webhooks

Webhooks are used to receive messages and updates from WhatsApp. You need to configure a webhook URL to listen to events.

### Webhook Setup
1. **Create a Webhook URL**: Deploy a publicly accessible endpoint on your server.
2. **Configure Webhooks on Facebook**: Subscribe your app to the relevant WhatsApp events in Facebook Business Manager.

### Example Event Payload
```json
{
  "contacts": [{
    "profile": {
      "name": "John Doe"
    },
    "wa_id": "123456789"
  }],
  "messages": [{
    "from": "123456789",
    "id": "message_id",
    "timestamp": "timestamp",
    "type": "text",
    "text": {
      "body": "Hello!"
    }
  }]
}
```

## 6. Rate Limits

Each WhatsApp Business Account is subject to message rate limits. Rate limits vary based on your account tier (e.g., 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 messages per day).

To check your rate limits:
```bash
GET /v1/account/limits
```
